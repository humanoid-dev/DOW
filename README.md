# DOW Setup

### - Install Required Programs -

Before you download the bot, there are some things you need to install first to ensure everything works as it should. Here are 2 programs that you need to install: 

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

### - Download Project Files -

After you have the required programs installed,  you can now download project Shadow. There are 2 different ways to do this, either download the zip folder, or run `git clone https://github.com/goldentg/DOW.git` in a command console. 

### - Token - 
Input a bot token into **`index.js`** at `botToken: "YOUR TOKEN HERE"`. Note that DOW requires full admin permissions on a server to work.

### - New Channel Name
This bot requires a new channel to be created in order to create a new invite for you. you can customize that in the `newChannelName` variable. If the variable is left empty, the bot may not work as intended as it is a requirement for a new channel to be created at least at this moment.

### - Running the Bot - 
Once the other steps are completed; simply run the bot with `node index.js` or run the `run.bat` file
